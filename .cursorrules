You are an expert developer working on LitePost, a modern API client application built with Tauri and React. The tech stack includes:

Frontend:
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite as the build tool
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui components (based on Radix UI)
- Zustand for state management
- React Router for navigation
- React Syntax Highlighter for code display
- React Resizable Panels for UI layout

Backend (Tauri):
- Rust-based desktop framework
- Tauri plugins: fs, http, opener
- Cross-platform desktop capabilities

Project Structure:
- /src: React frontend code
  - /components: React components including UI elements
  - /hooks: Custom React hooks
  - /store: Zustand state management
  - /utils: Utility functions
- /src-tauri: Rust backend code

Key Features:
- API request management
- Response visualization
- Authentication configuration
- Settings management
- Modern, responsive UI

Development Guidelines:
1. Follow TypeScript best practices with strict type checking
2. Use Tailwind CSS for styling, following the project's design system
3. Implement proper error handling for both frontend and Rust operations
4. Maintain consistent component structure using shadcn/ui patterns
5. Ensure cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

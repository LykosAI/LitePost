Based on the codebase and comparing with Postman, here are some key features we could add to enhance the functionality:

1. **Request Features**:
- **Authentication Support**
  - Basic Auth
  - Bearer Token
  - OAuth 2.0
  - API Key

Here's a basic implementation plan I would suggest:

1. First Priority (Core Features):

2. Second Priority (User Experience):
- Response formatting and previews
- Code generation
- Basic authentication support

3. Third Priority (Advanced Features):
- Collections
- Testing
- WebSocket/GraphQL support

Let me break down the core features we should prioritize first, without any code:

1. **Environment Variables & Management**
- Create/edit/delete environments (e.g., "Development", "Production")
- Variable substitution in requests (e.g., replace {{baseUrl}} with actual value)
- Quick environment switching
- Environment variable inheritance (global → environment-specific)

2. **Request/Response Improvements**
- Response syntax highlighting for JSON/XML/HTML
- Response size and timing metrics
- Request timing breakdown (DNS, TLS, First byte, etc.)
- Save responses as files
- Copy response as JSON/raw

3. **Basic Authentication Support**
- Basic Auth (username/password)
- Bearer Token auth
- API Key auth (as header or query param)
- Cookie management

4. **Request Organization**
- Save requests to collections
- Organize collections in folders
- Import/export collections
- Search across requests

5. **Request Building Improvements**
- Form data support
- File upload support
- Raw body input with syntax highlighting
- Query parameter builder with validation
- Better header management with common header suggestions

These features would provide a solid foundation similar to Postman's core functionality. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these areas?

<RequestUrlBar
  method={method}
  url={url}
  loading={loading}
  onMethodChange={onMethodChange}
  onUrlChange={onUrlChange}
  onSend={onSend}
  onSave={onSave}
  onTemplate={() => setTemplateDialogOpen(true)} // New prop
/>
```

2. **Environment Variable Preview**
- Show resolved environment variables inline in the URL/headers/body
- Add a toggle to switch between raw and resolved views

3. **Request Chaining**

4. **Bulk Operations**
```typescript:src/components/CollectionsPanel.tsx
// Add bulk import/export/delete for requests within collections
const handleBulkExport = (collectionId: string) => {
  const collection = collections.find(c => c.id === collectionId);
  // Export logic
}
```

5. **Request History Search Improvements**

Based on the codebase and comparing with Postman, here are some key features we could add to enhance the functionality:

1. **Request Features**:
- **Authentication Support**
  - Basic Auth
  - Bearer Token
  - OAuth 2.0
  - API Key

- **Cookie Management**
  - Cookie jar
  - Session handling
  - Domain-specific cookies

2. **Response Handling**:
- **Response Formatting**
  - JSON prettification with syntax highlighting
  - XML formatting
  - HTML preview
  - Image preview for image responses
  - PDF preview

- **Response Size and Time**
  - Show response size
  - Show request/response timing
  - Network timing breakdown

3. **Environment Management**:

4. **Collection Management**:

5. **Code Generation**:
- Generate code snippets for different languages (curl, Python, JavaScript, etc.)
- Copy as cURL command

6. **Testing Features**:

7. **WebSocket/GraphQL Support**:
- WebSocket connection handling
- GraphQL query builder
- GraphQL schema exploration

8. **Advanced Features**:
- **Proxy Configuration**
- **SSL Certificate Verification**
- **Request Chaining**
- **Pre-request Scripts**
- **Response Schemas**
- **File Upload Support**

9. **Collaboration Features**:
- **Team Workspaces**
- **Request Sharing**
- **Documentation**

Here's a basic implementation plan I would suggest:

1. First Priority (Core Features):

2. Second Priority (User Experience):
- Response formatting and previews
- Code generation
- Basic authentication support

3. Third Priority (Advanced Features):
- Collections
- Testing
- WebSocket/GraphQL support

Let me break down the core features we should prioritize first, without any code:

1. **Environment Variables & Management**
- Create/edit/delete environments (e.g., "Development", "Production")
- Variable substitution in requests (e.g., replace {{baseUrl}} with actual value)
- Quick environment switching
- Environment variable inheritance (global → environment-specific)

2. **Request/Response Improvements**
- Response syntax highlighting for JSON/XML/HTML
- Response size and timing metrics
- Request timing breakdown (DNS, TLS, First byte, etc.)
- Save responses as files
- Copy response as JSON/raw

3. **Basic Authentication Support**
- Basic Auth (username/password)
- Bearer Token auth
- API Key auth (as header or query param)
- Cookie management

4. **Request Organization**
- Save requests to collections
- Organize collections in folders
- Import/export collections
- Search across requests

5. **Request Building Improvements**
- Form data support
- File upload support
- Raw body input with syntax highlighting
- Query parameter builder with validation
- Better header management with common header suggestions

These features would provide a solid foundation similar to Postman's core functionality. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these areas?

Implemented Features:
1. Authentication Support:
   - Basic Auth ✅
   - Bearer Token ✅
   - API Key ✅ (both header and query param)

2. Response Handling:
   - JSON prettification with syntax highlighting ✅
   - HTML preview ✅
   - Image preview ✅
   - Response size metrics ✅
   - Request/response timing ✅
   - Network timing breakdown ✅ (DNS, First byte, Download time)

3. Code Generation:
   - Generate code snippets ✅ (curl, Python, JavaScript, C#, Go, Ruby)
   - Copy as cURL command ✅

Still To Do:
1. Authentication:
   - Basic Auth ✅
   - Bearer Token ✅
   - API Key ✅
   - OAuth 2.0 ❌

2. Cookie Management:
   - Basic cookie sending/receiving ✅
   - Persistent cookie jar ❌
   - Advanced session handling ❌
   - Domain/path-specific cookie rules ❌

3. Response Handling:
   - JSON prettification with syntax highlighting ✅
   - XML formatting ✅
   - HTML preview ✅
   - Image preview ✅
   - PDF preview ❌
   - Response size metrics ✅
   - Request/response timing ✅
   - Network timing breakdown ✅

4. Environment Management:
   - Create/edit/delete environments ✅
   - Variable substitution ✅
   - Environment switching ✅
   - Global/environment-specific variables ✅

5. Collection Management:
   - Save requests to collections ✅
   - Basic folder organization ✅
   - Import/export collections ✅
   - Postman format support ✅
   - Nested folders/hierarchical organization ❌
   - Collection variables ❌
   - Collection-level scripts ❌

6. Testing Features:
   - Basic test scripts ✅
   - Test assertions ✅
     - Status code ✅
     - JSON values ✅
     - Headers ✅
     - Response time ✅
   - Test runs with results ✅
   - Collection-level tests ❌
   - Data-driven tests ❌
   - Test reports and exports ❌

7. WebSocket/GraphQL Support:
   - WebSocket connections ❌
   - GraphQL query builder ❌
   - Schema exploration ❌

8. Advanced Features:
   - Proxy Configuration ❌
   - SSL Certificate Verification ❌
   - Request Chaining ❌
   - Pre-request Scripts ❌
   - Response Schemas ❌
   - File Upload Support ❌

9. Code Generation:
   - Generate code snippets ✅ (curl, Python, JavaScript, C#, Go, Ruby)
   - Copy as cURL command ✅

10. Collaboration Features:
    - Team Workspaces ❌
    - Request Sharing ❌
    - Documentation ❌

The most critical missing features that would significantly improve usability are:
1. Nested Collection Organization - for better request organization
2. Advanced Cookie Management - for better session handling across domains
3. Collection-level Testing - for automated API testing workflows
